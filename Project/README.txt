COURSE:   CS 6350.0u1, Summer 2024


DESCRIPTION:
"The project is an essential part of this class. It will allow you to demonstrate
your Big Data Analysis skills and create something that you are proud of. It can
also be a valuable addition to your projects portfolio that you can demonstrate to
prospective employers.

The project has two key components to it:
- Understanding a recent machine learning or analytics technique and
associated algorithm(s)
- Implement and apply it to a standard dataset of sufficient complexity"


HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN:
You can compile and run this program through a Databricks notebook; however, since I am submitting a 
public link to my Databricks notebook, the results of the program will already be displayed. 

To see a full list of details of my experiments' results, see the document "CS 6350 Project - Results."
There is also a report titled "CS 6350 Project - Final Report" that explains everything in more detail.
